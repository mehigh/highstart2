 * Smaller components should be placed in this folder. While layout/ is macro

 * It contains all kind of specific modules like a form, a slider, a loader,
 * a widget, and basically anything along those lines.
 * There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application
 * should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
